I was first introduce to Github when I was working as a HW grader in college. The professor who was my supervisor at the time, wanted to create automatic grading scripts to grade the students' C programs they wrote, saving us time and giving us valuable learning experience.

Obviously, this was a rather complex undertaking and he had to write a huge program to allow students to submit their assignments and allow our scripts to access their submissions via laulima. He could've just written it all up and attached those files in emails, and we could email him the source code of every script we wrote. However, He knew that would be too troublesome and he wanted to spare us the headache and teach us how to use an industry standard tool, and thus, gave us a walkthrough of how to use Github.
