# Overview

Parking at UH Manoa is extremely scarce. More and more students enroll every year, and whether you own a moped or a full size car, parking passes or parking spaces can be limitied. In addition, if you are at the dorms, overnight parking passes aren't gauranteed, there's an actual lottery for them.

There are many inventive techniques and ways people park their vehicles to skirt around this problem, often not officially accepted by the university however. This is why the UH Manoa campus has its own parking enforcement force.

For some people, there simply is no option to not break the law in order to park in the vicinity and make it to class on time, or to a scheduled test. People's methods like these often end up costing them in citations, which is not sustainable.

While ethical lines can be drawn, it is clear that having a method of knowing where the parking enforcement personnel are, where they've been, and where they're going, will help to avoid conflicts between illegally parked cars and enforcers.

Our implementation would be a web application that would rely on user observations and input to keep updated. For example, if someone sees active personnel in one area, they can log into the website and add to the records of where that personnel are now. Using data from previous entrie, the system can track the previous reportings and make predictions on where they plan to go to next.

Also, the point of having a login serves to hold users accountable and identify who is making the most updates. If there are officials attempting to fool or give the system false information, it can be traced back to them.

The physical look of the website, after passing through the login sceen, would be to select an area on a map to where the last parking personnel was spotted and at one time. That information will be added to the record. The user can then log out and continue their work.

# Mockup Page Ideas

Only one page. An interactive app to select location and time of last sighting and a submit button

# Base Case Ideas

User logs in, selects location on map and time of sighting. Clicks submit. Logs out.

# Beyond the Basics

Can tap into security cameras for automated reporting and upkeep
